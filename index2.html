			<h1>Plastics In The Ocean</h1>
						<p> 
							So what causes plastic pollution in general? And how does this plastic make its way to the ocean? One of hre biggest causes of plastic pollution is on the go lifestyles. Nowadays we are encouraged to have on the go lifestyles. However, these lifestyles require disposable, one time use products. These products will only be used once before we put them into the bin, often without a second thought or care. The problem here is that these products are most likely made from plastic, which can take up to 1000 years to break down. In addition to this we cannot just burn the plastic as this will release harmful chemicals and pollutants into the air, damaging all species (including ours!) health, damaging our earth, speeding up climate change, killing our crops and making our food inedible. Despite all this plastic continues to be one of the most widely available and overused items.
