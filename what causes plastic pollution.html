			<h1>What causes plastic pollution?</h1>
						<p> 
							Plastics in the ocean is a major issue that needs to be dealt with immediatly, and if we don't take action now, future generations<br> will live through marine animals extinction and it will be harder to stop this </p>
						<p>To many, plastic pollution in the ocean doesn't seem that big of a deal. Not often do we go out to sea or go diving to see just how big of a deal it is. However, for our marine life who live in these oceans and rely on having a clean, non toxic environment to stay alive, this is a very big deal. Plastic in the ocean can injure or even kill fish, seabirds and other marine mammals.  These species can often mistake plastic for food, causing them to ingest the plastic. When plastic is ingested it can lead to severe digestive issues, causing them to not be able to eat properly and in the end leading to death. If that isn't enough to convince you, when plastic is ingested by a fish and then that fish is then killed for food it will end up in our food chain where we will then ingest that food. Ingesting the toxins in these plastics can even lead to cancer, birth defects and immune system problems. Plastic not only harms fish and humans, but it has a severe effect on the sea turtles as well. Studies have found that over 50% of all sea turtles around the world have ingested plastic. When a sea turtle ingests plastic, it can lead to blockage in the gut and ulceration, which can eventually lead to death. Sea turtles can also get stuck in plastic or plastic nets that broke off from commercial fishing. If a sea turtle gets stuck in plastic and cannot get out then it will most likely die as this would make it very difficult for it to be able to get food. When plastic makes its way to the ocean it will stay there for up to 1000 years as it breaks down. However, as it breaks down it will leave toxins in the water, creating a toxic environment for all the species who consider the ocean their home. We need to think about where our plastic ends up and the effects it might have on other marine life.
