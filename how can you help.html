			<h1>How can you help?</h1>
						<p> 
							What can we do to help? The first thing we should look at doing is reducing the amount of plastic we use, especially if it is a one use product. Instead of using that plastic grocery bag go for a reusable canvas bag. Try beeswax wraps instead of gladwrap. Buy products with less plastic waste, like fruits and vegetables. The next step would be to reuse. Reuse any snaplock bags, any containers or anything you can that is made out of plastics. By reducing the amount of plastic you use and reusing any plastic that you buy you will not only be saving the earth but you will also be saving money! The next step would be to recycle. It would be almost impossible to reduce the plastic you throw away to nothing, so if you have to buy something with plastic or use plastic make sure it is recyclable first. By recycling you are making sure that that plastic will turn into a new product, instead of just ending up in the ocean. However, recycling is not a foolproof method, as some studies say the majority of the plastic that you put in the recycling bin ends up in the landfill.
