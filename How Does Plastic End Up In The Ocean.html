						<p> <br>How does this plastic pollution even end up into the ocean? Some of the more obvious ways would be people dumping plastic into the ocean, people littering and having the wind carry it into the ocean, etc but there are many different ways in which plastic can make its way into the ocean that might surprise you. Fishing nets are a big culprit. Fishing nets will often get broken or lost in the ocean. When this happens they will begin to leak very harmful toxins into the water, with some sea turtles and other marine mammals getting stuck in them. Plastic can even get to the ocean when it is travelling to the landfill. It can get blown away by the wind as it is being transported, ending up in drains or rivers that lead to the ocean. One of the most least obvious ways in which plastic gets into the ocean is through products that go down our drain. Sanitary products, cotton buds, wipes, microfibers (that come from washing our clothes) and microplastics are some examples of these. Because of how small they are they can often be overlooked. It is important that we don't overlook these as because of their small size they make it very easy for fish to consume and mistake for food.</p>
